# The Movie DB Tests
All of these SoFine Tests for TMDB were all made just for SoFi ;)
All tests are written in .Net Core and must be opened in Visual Studio 2017
The Run-down:
All tests are located in /test/Interface/Api/Movie
To discover tests, just build the solution
To run the tests open the Test Explorer window (in VS 2017: Test->Windows->Test Explorer), then cick Run All
For full written tests to actually pass, you must enter your Api Key, username and password and social security number(not really, im kidding) at the top of the class.
